# Welcome to the Ecommerce API!

Introducing the Ecommerce API, a powerful tool that allows seamless processing of user and product information for your ecommerce platform. This API is designed to provide essential functionalities, including user authentication, data validation, and retrieval of both product lists and individual products. Here's a comprehensive description of its key features:

1.  User Authentication: The API incorporates a robust authentication mechanism to ensure secure access to user-specific data. Users can register, log in, and receive authentication tokens to authorize subsequent requests.
2.  Data Validation: To maintain data integrity, the API implements comprehensive validation techniques. It ensures that user input adheres to specified constraints, such as required fields, data formats, and unique identifiers.
3.  Product Listing: The API enables users to retrieve a list of available products. This feature allows users to browse through a catalog of products, including information such as name, price, description, and availability. Pagination and sorting options can be utilized to enhance the browsing experience.
4.  Individual Product Details: Users can access detailed information about a specific product by providing the product's unique identifier. This feature retrieves comprehensive product attributes, such as images, specifications, reviews, and related information. Users can make informed decisions based on the product's complete details.
5.  Authorization and Permissions: The API provides role-based access control, allowing administrators and authorized users to perform specific actions. For example, administrators might have permissions to add or modify products, while regular users can only view or purchase items.
6.  Error Handling: The API incorporates comprehensive error handling mechanisms, providing meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes. This helps developers and users understand and troubleshoot issues encountered during API interactions.

-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

These technologies work together to create a robust and efficient API for your ecommerce platform. Node.js provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side, while Express is a popular web framework that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs. TypeScript adds static typing and enhanced tooling to the JavaScript language, improving code reliability and maintainability.

Prisma is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that facilitates database access and manipulation. It simplifies interactions with the PostgreSQL database by providing a convenient query builder, migrations, and type-safe database models.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system, serves as the persistent data storage for the Ecommerce API. It offers advanced features, scalability, and robustness, making it a suitable choice for managing product and user information securely.

By leveraging these technologies, this Ecommerce API can benefit from a high-performance, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
